## Take screenshots (e.g while watching your video courses) and then use the ___shotnote___ command to join them together and keep them in a nicely ordered printable document for future reviews!


In order to use "shotnote", take these steps:

1. install the dependency packages listed below:
* imagemagick (necessary for everyone)
* wkhtmltopdf (necessary for everyone)
* xvfb (only for those not connected to an X server)

2. add the source to the .bashrc file in your home directory

3. run "exec bash" to re-apply the .bashrc

4. Your life is easier now! cd (change directory) into the directory you keep your screenshots in, and run the command "_shotnote_".

__NOTICE__: Screenshots MUST be in PNG format for now. JPEG could be supported as well easily, but I didn't need it personally. :smile:

__NOTICE:__ To take screenshots you can use softwares like __SnagIt. SnagIt is recommended specially__ because it provides a myriad of useful options, like taking cropped screenshots, specifying output directory, setting file naming rules, option to work silently, etc.
